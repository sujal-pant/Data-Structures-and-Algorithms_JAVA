         *  file is compiled by the javac the compiler of java and then the source code is converted to
         * the byte code and then the JVM convert the byte code into the binaryfile.
         * java is a machine independened language
         * 
         * Java is a OOP language 
         * Every thing in java is written in classes
         * -->class is a user defined blueprint consisting of attribute and methods(fubction)
         * Example:
         * let us suppose a class named is "car" it has attribute as "
         * company, color price and method as run () open trubk () and open window()
         * 
         * cars are made as audi , bmw and so on--> these are instances of class (objects)
         * object --> instance of class
         *  to know the color /--> BMW.color()
         * 
         * Know about Public static void main ( Strings args [])
         * public --> access modifier
         * void --> empty
         * main --> function name ( entry point of java )
         * static-->allows to call this method without creating a object of class
         * string args [] -->[]--> list  agrs is a list / size can be any / 0th index (start from)
         *
